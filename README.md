# TDDTraining
This repository contains an iOS project which can be used as a starting point for code katas which are developed test driven with Objective-C. It uses CocoaPods to import [OCMockito](https://github.com/jonreid/OCMockito).

## The Roman Numbers Kata
This branch provides a starting point for the Roman Numbers code kata. The goal is to implement the method which converts an arabic number between 1 and at least 1000 into a roman number using TDD.

Here is a list of the basic roman numerals:

Roman numeral | Arabic number
------------- | -------------
I | 1
V | 5
X | 10
L | 50
C | 100
D | 500
M | 1000

**XLII is 42** (more examples here: http://www.roman-numerals.org/chart100.html)
